# Timeline
## For the first week
The backend team will have to implement [API #1](readme.md#api-1-user-auth). Later [API #2](readme.md#api-2-data-representation) and [API #3](readme.md#api-3-merchandise)

The Frontend Team for **Table UI** has to work assuming that the API will look _**exactly**_ like the one in [API #2](readme.md#api-2-data-representation).

The Frontend Team for **Merchandise and E-commerce** has to work assuming that the API will look _**exactly**_ like the one in [API #3](readme.md#api-3-merchandise).
